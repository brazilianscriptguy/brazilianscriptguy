## 🛡️ Engineering & Safety Principles

- ✅ **PowerShell 5.1 first**, PowerShell 7.x compatible where applicable  
- ✅ No destructive action without explicit intent (`ShouldProcess` enforced in core logic)  
- ✅ GUI-driven execution for operator safety when appropriate  
- ✅ Structured logging (`.log`) and exportable reports (`.csv`)  
- ✅ No hidden state, no silent failure patterns  

> The suite is continuously evaluated using **PSScriptAnalyzer**, **SARIF reporting**, and CI pipelines configured in **report-only mode** to ensure **visibility without delivery interruption**.

---

## 🔍 Quality, CI & Static Analysis

- PowerShell linting via **PSScriptAnalyzer**
- SARIF output integrated with **GitHub Code Scanning**
- Runtime-safety focused rule profile (low noise, high signal)
- PowerShell 5.1 compatibility validation
- Non-blocking CI: reports inform action, not gatekeeping

> Findings are surfaced as **artifacts and dashboards**, enabling controlled remediation cycles.
